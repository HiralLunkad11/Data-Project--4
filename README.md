In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis for the Healthcare Dataset to know the medical appointments being made by the patients.

Key Findings:
Appointments from female patients have exceeded those from male patients.
Ages 0 and 1 have 80% show rates for each age group, whereas the ratios of Nohow and Show are about equal for all age groups.
The show rate is almost 80% in each neighborhood.
A little over 80% of the 99666 patients without scholarships have visited, and about 75% of the 21801 patients with scholarships have visited as well.
Roughly 78% of the approximately 88,726 patients without hypertension and 85% of the 21,801 patients with hypertension who have visited have been diagnosed with the condition.
Around 102,584 patients without diabetes have visited, and about 80% of the 7,943 patients with diabetes have done the same.

Approximately 84% of the approximately 75,045 patients who have not received SMS have come for a visit, while approximately 72% of the approximately 35,482 patients who have received SMS have come for a visit.
There are comparatively few appointments on Saturday compared to other weekdays, and none on Sunday.
